# Basher

Sorry if this isn't S1aX0r's original goal, I can just make my own repo

Two modes:
1. generate a baseline of all the directories, file content, hashes, etc.
2. compare to that baseline

Auto prompt the user for things it finds are suspicious

TODO
1. Have multiple baselines, select the right one for the system
