# Basher

*NOTE* There are two versions of this script. Basher (original script) and main.py. Python has added abilities listed below.

Two modes:
1. generate a baseline of all the directories, file content, hashes, etc.
2. compare to that baseline

Auto prompt the user for things it finds are suspicious

*TODO*
1. Have multiple baselines, select the right one for the system
